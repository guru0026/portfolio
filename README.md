Hari's IMD Portfolio 2022

##OVERVIEW

The design of the portfolio was challenging to put it mildly. I had spent hours on the design of the actual layout, with close attention to the colour palette, the iconography, style, and the overall clean and minimal appeal which I wanted my site to have.

I also thought that keeping it clean and minimal would make it easy for coding, but I faced dozens of challenges. The most significant ones were:

* __Alignment and Sizing__: Since my design had *exact measurements* and *proportions*, even the slightest inconsistency was obvious and required a lot of input to correct.

* __Grid behaviour__: Getting the grid to align properly for changing screen sizes was also challenging. I wanted to retain the crisp corners of my checkered arrangement. I managed to keep the alignments proper by calculating all of the window sizes with exact measurements.  

I was unable to place multiple grids in my portfolio page, like I'd intended in the mockup for each of my sections. For spending so much time on a creative arrangement of my works, it was frustrating when I couldn't see the same materialize on the website.

All in all, I was happy with the actual design of the website, but I felt limited by my efficiency with coding.  
As somebody who is familiar with design but new to coding, I feel that I set a high standard of design, and for attempting to make any website of this nature for the first time, it was not flawless like I imagined in my head.  
I wish to get as good with my coding over the upcoming break as I am at my designs so that both skills complement each other well and I'm able to deliver better web designs. That would be my reflection from this exercies.
